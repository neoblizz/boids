We develop a framework that extends Craig Reynolds'~\cite{Reynolds:1987} boids simulation for simulating real flock like movements. We took the basic boids principles and extended it to show more complicated set of rules, used the GPU to introduce performance optimizations to better simulate the problem, and further expanded on the realism by adding local animations to the boids within the flock. Our work is available on the github repository found at \url{https://github.com/neoblizz/boids}.
