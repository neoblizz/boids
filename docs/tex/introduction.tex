Craig Reynolds program, Boids\cite{Reynolds:1987}, illustrated how flocks, herds and schools can be animated as artificial life using three simple rules. The word 'boid' originated from 'bird-oid object', which means 'bird-like object'. The simulation that Craig proposed follow the following three simple rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{separation}: as the name suggest, this simply means to avoid other local objects within the simulation.
    \item \textbf{alignment}: is aligning the direction of the local objects to the average heading of surrounding objects.
    \item \textbf{cohesion}: is movement towards the average position, which in a crowd is often the center of mass of the local objects.
\end{itemize}

These three rules, very simply and beautifully modeled the flock, herds and schools animation. The contribution of our project is to extend the Boids model, effectively called \textbf{Boids++}, to include more complex rules and to provide a framework and abstraction to define other custom rules not accounted for.
